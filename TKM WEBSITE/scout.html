           <h2>Boys Scout</h2>
           <p>Scouting was officially founded in British India in 1909, first starting at the Bishop Cotton Boys' School in Bangalore.
                Scouting for native Indians was started by Justice Vivian Bose, Madan Mohan, Hridayanath Kunzru, Girija Shankar Bajpai,
                 Annie Besant and George Arundale, in 1913. Prior to this date, Scouting was open only for British and foreign Scouts.
                  In 1916, a Cub section was started, followed by the Rover section in 1918.

            In 1916, Calcutta's Senior Deputy Commissioner of Police J. S. Wilson introduced Scouting for Boys as a textbook in the Calcutta
             Police Training School. Colonel Wilson volunteered his services to the District Scout Commissioner, Alfred Pickford, and in 1917 
             became Assistant Scoutmaster of the Old Mission Church Troop. Together the two struggled for the admission of Indian boys into the
              Boy Scouts Association, which had not been admitted due to a Government of India order against it because "Scouting might train
               them to become revolutionaries". Shortly Wilson was acting as Cubmaster and Scoutmaster, and succeeded Pickford as District 
               Commissioner in May 1919 when Pickford was promoted to Chief Scout Commissioner for India.

                <h2>Girls Guide</h2>
                <P>The first Girl Guides company was founded in Jabalpur in 1911 at Christ Church School The movement immediately grew: In 1915, more than
                     fifty companies existed with a membership of over 1,200, all of them directly registered with the Girl Guide Association and all 
                     restricted to girls of European descent. These companies formed the All India Girl Guides Association in 1916. In the same year the
                      organisation opened for Indian girls.

                    J. S. Wilson provided transportation for Girl Guide rallies.
                    
                    The girls themselves were never quite sure whether they preferred to ride in police vans or in the riot truck.
                     The former concealed them from public view, but were very hot; the latter, being cages of expanded metal, were 
                     cooler, but reminiscent of the Calcutta Zoo!
                    
                    In 1928, the All India Girl Guides Association joined the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts as
                     one of its founder members. This membership was renewed in 1948 after the independence of India and its partition.</P>
